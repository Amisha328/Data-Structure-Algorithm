// Empty The Piles
// Problem statement:
/*
There are n piles of stones arranged in row where the iâˆ’th pile has ai stones. 
You can perform certain operations on these piles. In one operation, you can select any non-empty pile and remove at most k
stones from it. Your goal to remove all the stones(i.e. empty all the n piles) in at most h operations. Find the minimum value of k
such that you can empty all the piles within h operations.

number of stones in each piles: [1  2  3  4]

k determines the min number of stones to be selected in single turn such that you can empty all the piles within h operations.

k = 1

turn 7:  [ 0 0 0 3 ]
turn 8:  [ 0 0 0 2 ]
turn 9:  [ 0 0 0 1 ]
turn 10:  [ 0 0 0 0 ]

10 operation > h (5) we can't take this.

k = 2
turn 1:  [ 0 2 3 4 ]
turn 2:  [ 0 0 3 4 ]
turn 3:  [ 0 0 1 4 ]
turn 4:  [ 0 0 0 4 ]
turn 5:  [ 0 0 0 2 ]
turn 6:  [ 0 0 0 0 ]

6 operations > h (5) we can't take this

k = 3
turn 1:  [ 0 2 3 4 ]
turn 2:  [ 0 0 3 4 ]
turn 3:  [ 0 0 0 4 ]
turn 4:  [ 0 0 0 1 ]
turn 5:  [ 0 0 0 0 ]

5 == h we can take this.

Observation:

with increase in value of k number of operation is decreasing.

Now, here our answer is the number of operations corresponding to value of k.

Hence, the functions f(k) = numberOfOperations, is montonically decreasing.

          This loop will work correctly for most cases, but it may fail for some large test cases.
          The problem is that the difference between L and R can become very large, which can cause the loop to take a long time to terminate.
          So we can try to run this loop for fixed number of time:
          TC of Binary search part is O(log(max value in array)) = log(1e9) ~ 30
          So, we can run loop for >= 30 times.
