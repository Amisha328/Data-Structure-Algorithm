# An array is a collection of items of same data type stored at contiguous memory locations. 

# Array elements are accessed with the help of indexes which usually begins with zero.

Advantages:

1) Random Access -> Array allows to access each element of array in constant time i.e., O(1) operation.
                  example:  To access 2 index element we can write arr[2].
   
   
2) Cache Friendliness -> This is only possible in arrays and not in any other data structure. Processors usually pre-fetch the items in nearby locations which is possible in array due to contiguous memory locations. 
                         This makes it faster as next element is very likely to be in the cache.
   This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).
